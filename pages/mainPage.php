					<p>Our vision is to take photo and album sharing to the next generation, making it smarter, more intuitive, and adaptive. Dispersing with irrelevant content and spam, and
					instead tuning the relationship between user and application.</p>
					<p>
					Borrowing from existing scrolling systems, andding additional dimensions, preventing scrolling from being
					limited to up and down.</p>
					<p>
					What if at the swipe or your hand you could travel not just back and forth in time, as you do on a traditional wall? But what if you could move with
					relevance, what if the parameters that matter to you as a user define the content you see every day?</p>
					<p>
					Content from years ago will flood you with memories you didn't know
					you still had at the more flourish of your finger.</p><p>
					Locations, people, times will present no boundaries for what you see, insted they will help bring to life your past.</p>
					<p>
					But not only your own content will be relevant, combining data from all
					postings will allow you to always see memories from new angles, different perspectives, and here the growth will be exponential.</p>
					<p>
					Imagine sitting with friends and having your best moments flow before you, breaking the norm of one divece
					for one person, now you can sit as many as will fit, and content will always be relevant, not limited.</p>

       		<p>
			  Together with our users we are the next generation photo and album sharing, where content is generated in a sandbox environment, based on parameters supplied inrealtime.<br>
			  Interaction is done through a multi dimensional UI, moving the focus from device to people, bringing us together and reminding us not just of who we are now,
			  but how we came to be there.<br>

          			As users interact with the application, their input will directly affect the content they access. The user is in charge of their journey through TimeFly, making it more relevant the more they interact with the application.

          			Essentially the algorithm is the manual labor a user would have been doing when they browsed through thousands of pictures. Instead the process is automated, serving pictures up in real-time without the frustration.
